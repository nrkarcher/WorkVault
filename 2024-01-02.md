Sean has a user who is running into the 15 minute issue with [[Licensing]]
- Do we want to use the users licensing to creat licenses for ourselves? Can we make an account for SW that only has one license? Can we use the clients account just to confirm that the issue is not on the server end?
- There could be something finnicky about the way that it was set up on the users side.
- Dave Lewis - single license. Thor Resources
- Support does not seem to be running into this issue yet.
- This might be specific to a user with 1 license
- Brooke is going to follow up with the user and get a good time to use the users license
- Test out the single license [[Task List]]
- Could the issue be related to the way that we are building client licenses through Cherwell?
- Is there a log on the 10duke side that we can look at? Is there any additional information that we can dump to the windows log when dealing with licenses?
