How we disappeared by Jing-Jing Lee follows the story of Wang-Di as she survives the horrors of being a "comfort girl" in Singapore during the Japanese occupation and Kevin in a more present day setting dealing with the death of his grandmother and looking for his relatives. This was a tough book to read, Wang-Di's experiences were harrowing and uncomfortable, the tension and fear were very present throughout. Switching to a Kevin chapter felt a deviation from the more compelling story and his story-line had significantly lower stakes giving me a bit of whiplash when switching between the two. Overall it was an interesting story, told from a perspective that I haven't heard before but it would be a tough book to recommend to someone. 3/5

There is no Antimemetics Division by qntm
This was my pick for book club, I saw it on a list of new science fiction novels and judging solely on the cover I decided that this looked like an interesting book. I went into this book with no prior knowledge and I'm glad that I did, it was certainly a unique story and fun to read. There was kind of an existential horror that goes with trying to fight(?) an entity that defies memory that made the conflict in the story different from anything else that I have read. Any other attempt I make to describe this book seems to slip from my memory but I will say that I enjoyed the novel and look forward to reading more from qntm. 4.5/5
