Decisions made:
- Dec 6 - Making the app project agnostic. The app will now no longer require a project to be open to operate. Stories will be updated to reflect that.
- Make sure to update the project start date on portfolios when a portfolio is started.

April 10 - Project Review

**Purpose:**

This meeting is to address the TGS projects progress, challenges and next steps. My goal is to create a safe space where we can openly discuss what’s working, what’s not, and how we move forward together. This project is critical for our companies strategic exposure with TGS, but we’re significantly over our initial timeline and estimates. I want to hear from each of you – what you see as the issues, how we can improve, and what we’ll commit to doing to get this back on track.

**Agenda:**

- Welcome and intent. Reminder: This is a safe space without blame – we’re focused on solutions, not excuses.
- Project recap:

- Started late Nov with 22 points/23 items, now at 48.5 points/47  items (and growing) with 25 points left. Initial target was mid-March, shifted to mid-April, now Phase 1 at end of April and Phase 2 TBD
- Some context: I’ll share my initial assumptions (Example team knew how to kick off with a charter and detailed plan) and where I might have misdirected by emphasizing learning over delivery.

- Team reflection:

- Each team member gets at least 2 min to share

- Your though on projects progress and challenges
- What you see as the goal/mission of this project from the companies perspective and your roles perspective
- Ideas for improvement

- Brainstorming:

- What we can do to ensure Phase 1 released by end of April? When can we realistically expect Phase 2? Practical steps (Other teams do Tetris - when you pre plan the next few sprints by dependencies for current project so you can get more accurate timeline based on dependencies), resources needed. What can be cut out and we will bite the bullet to refactor if needed after we have users using it (I know cost would be greater but it is something worth considering)

- Wrap up:

- Agree on next steps, owners, and deadlines

**Expectations:**

- Everyone contributes their perspective – no one sits out
- We leave with a clear plan to deliver Phase 1 and a timeline for Phase 2
- We align on projects strategic importance (exposure via TGS) while addressing the reality: at ~>$200k cost to date (based on $50k salary) we need ~15 licenses to break even as of today. We as a company cannot afford many delays like this

**Note:** I am not here to point fingers. I know there is complexity – new APIs, learning curves, my own assumptions – but lets focus on what we can control and how we succeed together.

Discussion:

Ed: mixed messages from sales and mgmt about requirements.
We don't have experience breaking things down
We didn't have documentation from TGS
Growth: came from bad assumptions

Disconnect between learning the processes and learning ADR's vs Trying to get something out the door

Lucius: We missed some things during the planning phase (tops writers, log writers). Only using 2 points to plan might have been too few.

Point: I am new to the team but I was surprised by the complexity of the existing work, especially the authentication. 

Opportunities early on to catch things that were missed. Unknown unknowns. Could have spent more time planning. 

Can we use this failure to learn from? How can we compare this to the planning being done by Abdel and Allen on the other team.


Moving forward: We understand the scope of what we need to do. The LAS serializer is a possible point of bugs.
