Bug Busters - We have been doing a balance of tickets getting some enhancements, tech debt and bugs cleared out of the backlog while we wait on the EULA to be completed and finally cut the final version of [[11.0 Upgrade|11.0]]. Kudos to Mila for helping out with the testing, the transition to shared testing has been seamless so far!
[[TGS]] - Nick has taken over the testing for the [[TGS]] team, there was a bit of a learning curve to get up to speed but the team has been very supportive and made the switch easy. We have been working on getting wells and tops importing from [[TGS]] and so far have wells importing with a simple click and drag.
