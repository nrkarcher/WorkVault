Phase 1 MVP

Good:
Duplicating XSV allowed us to move fast but we also had added tech debt to make that happen.
- We know what the cost is and it is well documented moving forward
- Documentation of all of our issues has also helped us to prevent making the same mistakes
Story Map
- From a PO perspective it is the best way to map out a project.
- The developers also liked the story map and found it to be helpful for keeping track of the project as well as when onboarding onto the team.
Having an internal stakeholder meeting was helpful
- We found that it was good to communicate with an internal stakeholder.
- We want to make this a rotating role for the developers on the team to get more exposure.

Mixed:
Tons of meetings up front
- Created a bit of meeting burn out among the team.
- Ultimately, planning things out in depth made the project easier in the long run
- Going forward we would like to space these meetings out more and know what project we are going to work on in the future. Management is working on this.

Bad:
How do we balance
