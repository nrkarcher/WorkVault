Phase 1 MVP

Good:
Duplicating XSV allowed us to move fast but we also had added tech debt to make that happen.
- We know what the cost is and it is well documented moving forward
- Documentation of all of our issues has also helped us to prevent making the same mistakes
Story Map
- From a PO perspective it is the best way to map out a project.
- The developers also liked the story map and found it to be helpful for keeping track of the project as well as when onboarding onto the team.
Having an internal stakeholder meeting was helpful
- We found that it was good to communicate with an internal stakeholder.
- We want to make this a rotating role for the developers on the team to get more exposure.
