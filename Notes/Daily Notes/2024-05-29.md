10.8.3 Post Mortem
D-11273 - Dropping licenses overnight
- For a lot of the problems that we ran into we were lacking sufficient data of the right type. We might not have enough directional surveys, production, zones, etc.
	- Maybe some of the older projects should be updated to include more of the newer data types.
	- Should be testing with bad data to ensure that error handling works better.
- From a development point of view 
- Sync error bugs - we should include more information in the sync error when we encounter sync errors.
