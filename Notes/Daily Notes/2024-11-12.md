Look at and update 11635
For next patch - putting in an error message instead of resolving things more than necessary.
Once that is fixed we are going to cut 10.8.6
Release and test plan for 10.8.6
Criticals - Filter one is in code review, 

11.0 one or so bugs left to go 11674 still needs to be fixed and then we can cut. 
There are still some stories left but we can do those after the cut.
Make sure that the test plan is good to go for 11.0
