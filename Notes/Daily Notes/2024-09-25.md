- What are the issues that we have encountered:
	- Having to rebuild a lot - having to delete bin folder. Seems to happen when hopping between branches especially 10.8 and 11.0
	- SDK unit tests failing to build - Story created
- Selective building can avoid running into this more often.
- Do we want to create an info dump of when these things are necessary and when they are a sign that something is wrong?
	- A wiki page for all of the info? Tips and tricks.
