Repo Health
- What are the issues that we have encountered:
	- Having to rebuild a lot - having to delete bin folder. Seems to happen when hopping between branches especially 10.8 and 11.0
	- SDK unit tests failing to build - Story created
- Selective building can avoid running into this more often.
- Do we want to create an info dump of when these things are necessary and when they are a sign that something is wrong?
	- A wiki page for all of the info? Tips and tricks.

Multiple Variables on the same line
- Do we want to make a coding standard against that?

Process changes for Code Reviews
- The bug busters - there are a lot of code reviews and the three day window can be restricting
- Add a one hour window to your calendar to do code reviews
- Feel free to push back on whether or not you need to be included in the code review.
- Hold others accountable to doing their code reviews - scrum is a good time to bring this up.
- Add people for specific reasons when applicable.
