Dev Retro

Issues with QT build environment
- Small issues with builds adding up to a larger impact over time.
- Build the individual libs/apps that the dev is currently working on to avoid compiling the tests
- Look into the SOFT post for the build environment - Garby
- Book meeting with Garby if you are running into issues with the build environment.

For QT containers use value() instead of []
- problem: Because this is in the API server and that needs to be stable we need extra protections in the event of a crash.
- This is already included in Effective Seisware but we want this to be more solid, add this to the coding standards - Garby

Res Difficulties
- Rolf and Sam

Switch everyone to use git http
- If you haven't done this yet, please do. There is a a SOFT post for this that can provide more info

Need 2 docs to set up a new build environment
- Using only one does not fully complete the set up.
- Clean up the docs - Garby
- Script - Ed V

Swap over SW solution + toolkit on Buildserver
- Due to some code changes we won't be able to do this until after 11.0.
- Do we want to deal with the timeout situation? Yes, we have brought those tickets into the 2025 priorities.
- Make sure that we are prioritizing this work in the new year - Abdel

Critical/Support Needs Help - Captain
