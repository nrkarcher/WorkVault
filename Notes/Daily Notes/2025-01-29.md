Issues with QT build environment
- Small issues with builds adding up to a larger impact over time.
- Build the individual libs/apps that the dev is currently working on to avoid compiling the tests
- Look into the SOFT post for the build environment - Garby
- Book meeting with Garby if you are running into issues with the build environment.

For QT containers use value() instead of []
- problem: Because this is in the API server and that needs to be stable we need extra protections in the event of a crash.
- This is already included in Effective Seisware but we want this to be more solid, add this to the coding standards - Garby
