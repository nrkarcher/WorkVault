Food Bank Volunteering

On July 26th a few SeisWare employees, Gabriela, Stephanie, Amber and Nick, visited the Calgary Food Bank to volunteer. Personally this was my first time volunteering at the food bank and I didn't know what to expect (or the correct desk to check in at). I found out that there are a few different jobs available to take on at the food bank and for this visit we were assigned to sorting fresh fruits and vegetables. This means separating out all of the rotten fruits and vegetables and bagging the good produce to go out to the food banks clients. Peeling rotten layers off of onions until they were good to go out was not my favorite job and left me with a temporary dislike of onions and an unpleasant lingering odor.
