Andrew managed to rep the license issue and get the sync error to happen.
If this issue is added does it need to be reviewed by the tech team? Maybe mention that to Rob on Monday and see if that can be included.

Beirut Hellfire Society by Rawi Hage details the story of Pavlov as he takes over the family business as an undertaker in Beirut during the Lebanese civil war. This novel had fairly dark subject matter and a bleak style that really drove home the tone of the setting as well as the characters. The violence in this book seems very matter-of-fact and conveys the brutality of the war in a way that felt very grounded. My only real complaint was that I wanted to know more about the Hellfire Society and had hoped that storyline would feature more prominently. Overall, I enjoyed this novel and would consider it to be one of the best that we have read in 2023.
