Retro discussion topics:

Hey all here are the discussion topics so please read over this and see if you have anything to add tomorrow! Thanks

- How much value are you getting out of 360s? This is a very good discussion to bring up considering we do these 2 times a year. Thanks Garby Gilbert for brining it up.
- Why do we take scrum notes Mohamed Benzreba added this in.  Does anyone think this is worth keeping? I personally want to remove them all apart from last 2 sprints (I read over them when I am away and want a general idea of what has been going on). How often do we go back and look over these
- 5-10 workflow overview for different apps. Not sure if this was more of a question that Andrew Mooney answered there Garby Gilbert? 
- I want to delete portfolios with consent from Mohamed Benzreba . Clean up our backlogs - maybe start with tech debt and unifying that - or did you have something more specific in mind?
- Consistent process across teams from Nicholas Archer and also what I shared in the picture below that. some teams leave things in none column other teams do not - some teams take stories out when they want to finish them. No consistency - should we come up with something across all 3 teams or leave it up to the team? Does it matter?
- Successful sprint - last sprint (As per image) we had 90 items of which 37 were complete and 18 didn't get started (40% complete 20% not started). How does the team feel about this - I think we are going through items and closing stories/bugs at a good rate. How does the team feel if our sprint looks like this? Any concerns, do we want to change anything?

Notes:
- Adding hours for "understanding" or "learning" can be helpful for other teams who have new team members.
- 360's
	- Comments are more valuable than ratings - Sam
	- Should we have a survey on what we think of the 360's? 
	- Managers are looking for trends in KPI's 
	- Shorter surveys for more people?
	- Primary goal
