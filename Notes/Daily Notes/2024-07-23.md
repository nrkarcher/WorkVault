Gunny Bears

The Gunny Bears team has been hard at work finishing up the MVP for the Gun Barrel Viewer. We have one more sprint of work and clean up to complete before we'll be moving on to our next project. Kudos to the development team for their diligent work recognizing the mistakes that we made and course correcting as well as their ability to adapt to changing teams. In addition to all of the work that we have done we have also greatly improved our Connections/Bandle skills and could easily take on any other team head to head.
