QA meeting

A few things for you to verify:

- On Monday I have you scheduled to meet with her at 1:00 for an hour. Is that reasonable? Anyone else in that meeting?
	- Good to go.
- Verify what day the team will take her out for lunch â€“ I will also plan to do the office walk through with her on the same day.
	- Wednesday lunch - March 6th - Bucannons - book  
- FYI - I think I will also check with Rob to see if he wants to meet with her around 3:00ish on the Monday (following our mngt mtg & PO mtg)
	- Yes
