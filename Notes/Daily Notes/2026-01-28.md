Demo

**1. The problem or idea (1–2 minutes)**

- What problem, workflow, or opportunity are you addressing?
- Why does it matter?

The issue being addressed is mostly an internal one, more specifically one that I have encountered. I go through a lot of test projects and test data and I am not great at clearing it out once I'm done with it. So we developed a tool to save the user some disc space and consolidate their data. 

Users will sometimes reuse the same seismic data across multiple projects

**2. What you built (2–4 minutes)**

- Show the features, workflow, or prototype you created
- Walk through the key parts of the demo
- Focus on clarity over polish

**3. How you used AI / Vibe Coding (2–3 minutes)**

- What role did AI play in your process?
- How did it help you explore, iterate, or build faster?
- We’re looking for **intentional, thoughtful use of AI**

**4. What you learned / what’s next (optional, ~1 minute)**

- What worked well?
- What surprised you?
- Where could this go next?
