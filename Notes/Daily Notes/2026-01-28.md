Demo

**1. The problem or idea (1–2 minutes)**

- What problem, workflow, or opportunity are you addressing?
- Why does it matter?

The issue being addressed is mostly an internal one, more specifically one that I have encountered. I go through a lot of test projects and test data and I am not great at clearing it out once I'm done with it. So we developed a tool to save the user some disc space and consolidate their data. 

Users will sometimes reuse the same seismic data across multiple projects, often making copies of the same data and clogging up their hard drive with redundant data. This tool allows the user to find all of the projects in their project list that have the same data and reset the paths of those files so that they all point to the same file, eliminating the need for multiple copies of the same data.

Additionally our current project properties does not allow the user to delete data off of their hard drive, as a result if the user wants to fully remove a project they have to delete it manually.

**2. What you built (2–4 minutes)**

- Show the features, workflow, or prototype you created
- Walk through the key parts of the demo
- Focus on clarity over polish

Demo Runthrough



**3. How you used AI / Vibe Coding (2–3 minutes)**

- What role did AI play in your process?
- How did it help you explore, iterate, or build faster?
- We’re looking for **intentional, thoughtful use of AI**

**4. What you learned / what’s next (optional, ~1 minute)**

- What worked well?
- What surprised you?
- Where could this go next?
