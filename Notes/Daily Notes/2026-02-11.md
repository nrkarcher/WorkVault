Toolkit libraries to be DLL's
- Static libraries cause slow builds for toolkit, DLL's would fix this.
- Remember to deal with the installer.
- Create/verify the existence of an md file - Garby
- Pick a couple of libs and see how long they take.
- Garby - fix/delete the wiki QT barebones app/QT static lib 

Standard for Class Documentation headers?
- Doxygen style tags are available, should we be using this?
- If we already use these in the SDK should we use these across the rest of the toolkit? Yes.
- Muhammed - Add this to the coding standards documentation (Effective SeisWare)

Member variable initialization: rules for header vs implementation?
- Optimize for runtime rather than compile time? Doubtful that this would cause a difference for users.
- Garby - Update standards documentation
- Emphasis on what we do not want

Accountability
- How did the smart goals go?
- We added some at the start of the sprint but fell off near the end.
- Stay curious and try to find places
- Keep on the SCRUM goals - As a scrumlord try to add these in.
