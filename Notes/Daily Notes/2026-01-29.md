When you first open the application you are presented with this screen which gives the user a chance to select the project list that they want to work from

We'll select this list for the purposes of the demo

You then have a 2 list selector to select the projects that you want to compare. and we also have this additional feature that allows for the deletion of project data.

In the project deletion manager we give you a list of all of the projects on your selected project list, their location and an estimate of the size of the folder. The user then has the option to delete the files from the disk to clear out more space. 

Once that is done you can get back to the comparison features. Select the projects that you want to compare. 

When this has loaded you can see all of the duplicate seismic files in the projects that we selected and their locations. The columns are sortable and the searchable to narrow down to what we are looking for. 

Once we have found our duplicate that we want to deal with we can open the repathing application to modify the paths of the seismic lines to consolidate the files to all point to the same location.

We added in the wells as another tab but only got it to the point of viewing data before we ran out of time.
