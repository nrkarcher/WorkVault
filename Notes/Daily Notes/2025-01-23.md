When we were kids I had a hamster who was incredibly talented at escaping his cage. A real Houdini act. It seemed like at least once a month that this tiny animal would escape or be caught dangling from the ceiling of his cage trying to undo the door on top. It was during one of these fateful escapes that we learnt of my grandmothers intense fear of rodents. One day when Grandma was babysitting we were off minding our own business when from the other end of the house we heard a blood-curdling scream. Grandma had been putting away laundry when she discovered my hamster had taken up residence in my sock drawer. She bolted out of the room closing the door behind her. The hamster remained free. It took years, even after the hamster was long gone, before she ever set foot in our house again. From then on, we would visit her at her home, as long as we promised not to bring any pets.
