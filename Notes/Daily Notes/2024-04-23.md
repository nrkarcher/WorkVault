QA writeup
This past month for the bug busters has been wrapping up the last of the SDK refactor stories we are down to the last 2 data types. Big shout out to Jordan and Carter who have done a lot of great work on this project but will be leaving us to return to school. We're transitioning to doing more and more bugs and enhancements to bring value to customers and balance our tech debt, bug and enhancement buckets.
