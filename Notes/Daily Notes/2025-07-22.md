Dept Updates
[[TGS]] - Most of the code has been completed and we are on to the testing and integration, the last steps before the full app functionality is available to clients. With that we have dissolved the [[TGS]] team and are looking forward to the next project. Big shout out to Andrew and Rolf for helping out with the final stretch of testing!
Glitch Gremlins have made the bold choice to change the name of the team to the Bugs Bunnies as they absorb the developers from the [[TGS]] team. Despite the change in name the team will be continuing to provide consistent bug fixes as well as addressing some much needed tech debt. We have also added Bilqis to the team who is quickly ramping up her involvement and testing for the team.
