Dept Updates
TGS - Most of the code has been completed and we are on to the testing and integration, the last steps before the full app functionality is available to clients. With that we have dissolved the TGS team and are looking forward to the next project. Big shout out to Andrew and Rolf for helping out with the final stretch of testing!
Glitch Gremlins have made the bold choice to change the name of the team to the Bugs Bunnies as they absorb the developers from the TGS team. We have added Bilqis to the t continuing to provide consistent bug fixes as well as addressing some much needed tech debt.
