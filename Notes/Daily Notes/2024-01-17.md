- 11.0 Release - Pros and Cons
	- Ed: I would like to see it pushed out
	- What are we releasing for 11.0? Mostly tech debt, and faults. Anything that was marked as "fixed on major" and could potentially break backwards compatibility. SDK changes.

	- Some strong advocates, a few people indifferent no strong detractors.

	- Whenever you are making code changes just remove them.
