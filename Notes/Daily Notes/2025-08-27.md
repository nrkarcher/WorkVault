AI agents
- Can be helpful for new things, some issues with hallucinations.
- Starting out in something that you are not comfortable with it can be a good starting point.
- Should we be documenting when we use an AI tool? No, our code should all be to the same standard and vetted regardless of human or AI generated.
- Security of our IP? Is there a limit to the things that we can give to AI?

Function Formatting
- Separate long functions into multiple lines for better readability.
- We have a python version of this.
- Should we have a character limit on the C++ side.
- Allen look into Clang format to see if there is an option for this.

Retro

Mercury
- What is the definition of "done" with this product?
- Book a meeting with Ed Chow, Rob and possibly Murray to clarify

Shared Whiteboard
- We are good to use the Miro board to plan this out

Miro
- Who cleans this up?

QA bottleneck
- Currently training up Bilqis and losing devs.

AI and IP
- Currently we have no restrictions on the AI models or what we are sharing.
- Is there a distinction between SW and Mercury?
- What are the risks?
- "Should probably minimally turn off the share with the model option"
