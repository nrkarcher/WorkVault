Standardize that member initializer lists must match order of declaration.
- Older C++ standards don't warn against out-of-order initialization (C++ 23 FINALLY does but we don't use it yet). Initialization order depends on the order that member variables are declared in the class not the constructor, which can lead to crashes and nasty stuff if B's initialization relies on A's.
- Try to avoid having member variables initialize other member variables.

Cancel builds that are expected to fail
- TeamCity wiki page has a blurb about how to disable particular branches.
- Dev wiki also has a TeamCity page.
