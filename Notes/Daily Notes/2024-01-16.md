Look into pair testing with Kathryn next week on the horizon app.
Does WGI go into 10.8.3? Backbuilding as well?
Can 10.8.3 release with just licensing issues - Yes unless WGI is good to go, then that will be included.
Default licenses - Kathryn is going to add a ticket.
LCWZA - We won't be re-writing and won't be changing any licenses will only be available in geology
