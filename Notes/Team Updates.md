The Gunny Bears have completed all of the tickets for the Gun Barrel MVP! We spent a lot of time planning this project out and it's great to see it come together. We learnt a lot over the course of this project and look forward to starting in on the next. Thanks in advance to those who help out with the cross team testing for the gun barrels. We're also excited to have 10.8.5 tested and ready to go. And a big welcome back to Pranj, happy to have you on the SeisWare team.
