The Gunny Bears have completed all of the tickets for the Gun Barrel MVP! We spent a lot of time planning this project out and it's great to see it come together. We learnt a lot over the course of this project and look forward to starting in on the next. Thanks in advance to those who help out with the cross team testing for the gun barrels. We're also excited to have 10.8.5 tested and ready to go. And a big welcome back to Pranj, happy to have you on the SeisWare team.

The Gunny bears have completed the last of the clean up stories for the gun barrel project and have started in on the planning stages for the next project. We also welcomed Pranj to the team and have been getting him trained up on SeisWare and QA process, in preparation for him taking on the upcoming TGS project. We did a team re-shuffle and the Bug Busters team has embraced the prison-yard style of scrum. I've begun brewing wine in my toilet,  the fermentation process has begun, and my apartment fills with a sweet, intoxicating aroma, reminiscent of dreams and distant memories. I am looking forward to maturation and bottling process (Don't worry, I'll share). Also, our scrum updates seem to be going faster.

The bug busters have been hard at work finishing up a lot of the tech debt and bugs surrounding the 11.0 release. On a related note we have also escaped the clutches of Cyber-Saddam. Admittedly, I didn't really follow the plot line for the C-S saga, so I can't really explain what happened, but I appreciate that Mo is trying something new and interesting in an attempt to improve Scrum meetings.  The TGS team has been making progress on the beginning stages of the TGS project and luckily aren't suffering too much with the absence of Pranj. Big shout out to the developers on both teams for helping out with testing while we work on the 10.8.6 release as well as the 11.0 test plan.

After a bit of a break the Bug Busters team is back to finishing off the last of the bugs and tech debt associated with the 11.0 release. We had a change of scrum lord and Aidan has taken over the reigns of the team, so far no Prison terms or Cyber Saddams but I look forward to his scrum style. We have also taken on the digital.ai/middleware/hubspot connectivity and are working towards having those services integrated. If you run into any issues with the tickets moving between hubspot and digital.ai please let Nick know.
