Training ideas
Alana's Videos - Add those to the curriculum, watching those videos for more background information.
Scheduled meetings at the end of the day during the first little bit. Post planning meeting with the new hire to discuss tickets on their board.
Add dev and PO wiki for optional training - Dev training videos as well
QA wiki
- move QA sprint work over to getting started and updating that as well
- Add registry reset instructions
- Crucible link
- Licensing information (from Andrew?)

Issues:
- Projects moved - Update documentation
- Project 1 doesn't open by default - make the instructions more clear, the project should be copied.
- Go through the project set-up and upgrade with the new user.
- Data loading requirement is unclear in training schedule
- On page 53 of that module is 82-2-115.STK.0.sgy a typo? I can't find that file anywhere but I have 84-2-115.STK.0.sgy
- Data Loading QC Checklist exercise what values I should be comparing the shot point values to? It says "Values should correspond to tape label and tape case"
- Synthetics could be explained better
