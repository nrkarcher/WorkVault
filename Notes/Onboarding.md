Training ideas
Alana's Videos - Add those to the curriculum, watching those videos for more background information.
Scheduled meetings at the end of the day during the first little bit. Post planning meeting with the new hire to discuss tickets on their board.
Add dev and PO wiki for optional training - Dev training videos as well
QA wiki
- move QA sprint work over to getting started and updating that as well
- Add registry reset instructions
- Crucible link
- Licensing information (from Andrew?)

Issues:
Projects moved - Update documentation
Project 1 doesn't open by default - make the instructions more clear, the project should be copied.
Go through the project set-up and upgrade with the new user.
