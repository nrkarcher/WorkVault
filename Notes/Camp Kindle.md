Another year is in the books of volunteering at Camp Kindle. We had a great turn out this year and everyone was able to help out with some of the tasks that needed to be done. This year we were assigned with turning a barn into the bones of an escape room, not our typical skill set but I think we did a great job. Part of the team was assigned to installing drywall, attempting to use more mud than actual drywall to hold the place together. Others were assigned to paint the interior walls, getting almost as much paint on the wall as the person painting it. We also fixed up the stairs and installed some carpet which seemed to go fairly smoothly. And we finished it off with staining a deck. 

We had great weather and it was great to get out of the office and doing something active, and it helps that it's for a good cause. Looking forward to next year.
