D-11545
"The algorithm used was incorrect"
The fix was for a specific data set - resolved for that data but broken for other data.
Hoping that this would fix D-11638 as well.
Code reviews - Senior assigned to all junior bugs. Or at least if we are altering common code.
Make sure that we are asking more questions about that.
Book a meeting for developing testing notes. Ask Mila and Pranj as well.
- Book this with Sam and Allen.
